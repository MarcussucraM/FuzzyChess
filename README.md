TODO: (as of 12/06/2020)

GUI -
Complete, but animations/transitions for capturing could be
added and new sprites/board styles could also be an improvement
New Mode -
No Rolls: Play the game as normal but without dice rolls involved
GUI and AI updated to compensate for this option.

Game Logic - 
As far as I know - everything works and there are no bugs  
  
AI - 
Multiple modes:
Very Easy : Random Moves
Easy      : No Lookahead
Medium    : 3 turn lookahead
Hard      : 5 turn lookahead

AI can be improved upon - right now it uses minimax vs
a distributed AI - the move generation algorithm is okay,
but kind of ugly and can be improved upon. The heuristic
functions too could be thought into a bit more.
Nevertheless - it works and provides somewhat of a challenge.
