TODO: (as of 11/7/20)

As of now - GUI is mostly complete and AI is needed to be worked on

Game Logic - 
 All logic is now sound - only updates to models package now is just some really minor tweaks to updating
 the board colors - other than that everything is in place completely to start GUI/AI
  
GUI -
 Most functions of game work now in interface
 -Needed-
  Captured peices display - Planning on working on that very soon 
  Dice Roll/Combat Display - Minor tweaks needed - I want to have the roll animation finish before peices move
  Menu - as of now the menu doesnt work at all - need functionality
  End Turn Button - easy implementation - to do soon
  
  
AI - 
I think the AI can be started on even while the GUI isn't finished - currently there is a console version of
the game that works pretty well as a test platform but the GUI works well enough for testing too. I'll probably update it a bit too.


If any of you guys have questions about the code please ask - and document! - dont be over the top though!
