TODO: (as of 11/9/20)

As of now - GUI is mostly complete and AI is needed to be worked on

Game Logic - 
 All logic is now sound - only updates to models package now is just some really minor tweaks to updating
 the board colors - other than that everything is in place completely to start GUI/AI
 -bugs: Currently capturing a leader for some reason when transferring members to kings corp removes king from its own corp
        subturns working fine now however.
  
GUI -
 Most functions of game work now in interface
 -extra themes/more sprites for user customization could be implemented possibly
 -animations between movements/captures like rooks firing arrows, knights charging, etc could be added
 -need howto page
  
  
AI - 
Basic AI completed - has scoring system to evaluate best moves
Found in AI testing fork
