# FuzzyChess
Senior Capstone Project for Kennesaw State University


TODO: (as of 11/2/20)

As of now - game logic is mostly complete and is good enough to begin AI and GUI implementation

Game Logic - 
 getMove()/getCapture() methods in FuzzyChess 
  -I want to mesh these into one method
  -Right now basic capture logic is sound but rook and knight capture logic needs to be implemented
  -I(Marcus) will do this sometime before wednesday
  
GUI -
 Everything that you need to create the GUI should be found in the FuzzyChess class - make it similar
 to how our other implementation was.
 -Needed-
  Gameboard display
  Captured peices display
  Status of game (turns/moves/whos turn/etc)
  Dice Roll/Combat Display - we can use the popup or hide the board and show this while its running
  I want to get rid of the Log - I dont think its necessary really
  Anything else you want to implement that could add to the game (text overlays to display endturn/arrow animations/etc)
  Also drag and drop is okay if you want - but perhaps just stick to clicking and updating screen on click
  
AI - 
I think the AI can be started on even while the GUI isn't finished - currently there is a console version of
the game that works pretty well as a test platform. I'll probably update it a bit too.


If any of you guys have questions about the code please ask - and document! - dont be over the top though!
